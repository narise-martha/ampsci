Catch2 is mainly a unit testing framework for C++, but it also provides basic micro-benchmarking features, and simple BDD macros.

Catch2's main advantage is that using it is both simple and natural. Tests autoregister themselves and do not have to be named with valid identifiers, assertions look like normal C++ code, and sections provide a nice way to share set-up and tear-down code in tests.
